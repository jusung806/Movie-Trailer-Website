# Movie-Trailer-Website
First project for the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree
# Introduction
This is the first project for the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program with Udacity.  This is a back end code to make a website listing your favorite movies as well as showing the trailer, a movie description, and title of the movie for others to enjoy.
# Requirements
You will need to use python Version 2.7 or greater as well as a web browser (I.E. Chrome).
# Details
You will be using the following files:
  1. entertainment_center.py
    * This provides the information the movie details that media.py uses to run the code.
  2. media.py
    * This code creates the movie title, poster image, trailer, and movie storyline.
  3. fresh_tomatoes.py
    * This is used for the front end of your website.
# Goal
The end result of this code is to develop a website.  This website should show the trailer of the movie on the screen when you click on the movie image.
